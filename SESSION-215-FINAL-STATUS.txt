   - Captured 9 verification screenshots
   - Identified specific bugs and missing features

3. ✅ Documentation Complete
   - Updated claude-progress.txt with detailed findings
   - Created comprehensive test notes
   - Listed all missing keyboard shortcuts
   - Provided prioritized recommendations for fixes

FEATURE 162 TEST RESULTS
=========================

WORKING ✅:

- Enter key selects commands
- New conversation creation via keyboard

- Text search/filtering works perfectly
- Shows all expected commands
- Enter selection works
- Arrow keys don't provide visual feedback
- Settings selection doesn't work properly

Settings Modal:

- Contains all expected tabs
- Settings save correctly
- Esc key does NOT close it (must click Done)

Sidebar:
- Displays conversations correctly
- Mouse click navigation works
- NO keyboard navigation support

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT SESSION
=================================

HIGH PRIORITY (Quick Wins):
1. Add Esc key handler to close Settings modal
2. Fix Settings command in palette to open modal
3. Add arrow key visual highlighting in command palette

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
4. Implement arrow key navigation in sidebar
5. Add visual focus indicators
6. Implement Enter to open conversation

LOW PRIORITY:
7. Add Tab key navigation in settings
8. Add keyboard shortcut for stop generation
9. Add keyboard shortcuts help (Cmd+/)

CURRENT STATE
=============

Progress: 169/175 features passing (96.57%)
Failing Features: 6 (all comprehensive workflow tests)
- Feature 157: Missing folder system
- Feature 158: Missing folder/archive features
- Feature 159: Missing artifact sharing
- Feature 160: Missing code theme selector, needs testing
- Feature 161: Multi-modal (images), needs testing
- Feature 162: Missing keyboard navigation features

APPLICATION STATE
=================

Servers: Both running (Frontend: 5173, Backend: 3001)
Database: Clean state with test conversations
Git: All changes committed
Code Quality: Production-ready, no console errors
UI: Polished and functional

NEXT STEPS
==========

The application is in excellent shape at 96.57% completion. The remaining 6 features all require either:
1. New features (folder system, image handling)
2. Missing UI components (code theme selector)
3. Keyboard navigation enhancements

Recommended approach for next session:
1. Try implementing quick win: Esc to close Settings (30 min fix)
2. Test Features 160-161 to see if they can pass with minor fixes
3. OR implement folder system if time permits (major feature)

The codebase is clean, committed, and ready for the next session.
