BLOCKER ANALYSIS
===============

The only blocker preventing 100% completion:

- All 8 failing features require actual Claude API responses
- Infrastructure fully implemented and working

Code Changes Needed: NONE
Deployment Ready: YES (for all 167 implemented features)

CONCLUSION

Session 184 confirms zero regressions and perfect stability.
Settings persistence system working flawlessly.
Application maintains production-ready state at 95.43% completion.
