SESSION 223 - FEATURE 159 TESTING PROGRESS
==========================================

SUMMARY:
Testing Feature 159 (Comprehensive workflow - artifact iteration and collaboration)
Progress: Steps 1-5 complete (5/14 steps = 36%)

COMPLETED STEPS:
✅ Step 1: Start conversation - WORKS
✅ Step 2: Request 'Create a landing page with HTML and CSS' - WORKS  
✅ Step 3: HTML artifact appears with live preview - WORKS
   - Artifact panel opened on right side
   - Beautiful landing page preview showing "TechFlow" branding
   - Hero section with "Welcome to the Future" headline
   - "Get Started Today" CTA button
   - Navigation menu (Home, Features, About, Contact)
✅ Step 4: View full-screen preview - WORKS
   - Fullscreen button successfully clicked (3rd icon button in artifact header)
   - Artifact panel expanded to nearly full window size (1388x772)
✅ Step 5: Exit full-screen - WORKS
   - Can toggle back and forth

REMAINING STEPS (9/14):
⏸️ Step 6: Edit artifact to change headline
⏸️ Step 7: Save changes  
⏸️ Step 8: Re-prompt 'Make it mobile responsive'
⏸️ Step 9: Verify new version created
⏸️ Step 10: Browse artifact version history
⏸️ Step 11: Compare version 1 and version 2
⏸️ Step 12: Download final version
⏸️ Step 13: Share conversation link
⏸️ Step 14: Verify shared link shows artifacts in read-only mode

KEY FINDINGS:
- Artifact creation and preview working excellently
- Fullscreen toggle implemented and functional
- Live HTML/CSS preview rendering correctly in iframe
- Artifact panel UI polished with clear icon buttons

BLOCKERS FOR COMPLETION:
- Version history feature (Steps 10-11) - mentioned in progress notes as not implemented
- Need to verify if artifact editing (Step 6-7) creates versions
- Share feature (Steps 13-14) needs testing

RECOMMENDATION:
Feature 159 cannot be marked as fully passing due to missing version history feature (Steps 10-11).
However, significant functionality is working (artifact creation, preview, fullscreen).
Consider this a PARTIAL PASS or need to implement version history to complete.
