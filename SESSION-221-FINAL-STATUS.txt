DECISION
========

Feature 158: NOT MARKED AS PASSING

Rationale:
- Only 75% of steps verified (9/12)
- Missing critical features: project analytics, complete archive verification
- Test specification requires all 12 steps to pass
- These features likely exist but need more time to locate/verify

WHY NOT PASSING
===============

1. Project Analytics (Steps 9-10):
   - Could not locate project analytics/usage UI
   - May be in project dropdown, settings, or separate page
   - Essential for complete project management
   - Estimated: 10 min to locate and test

2. Archive Verification (Steps 11-12):
   - Archive option exists in context menu
   - Attempted to archive but verification incomplete
   - Archived tab showed "No conversations yet"
   - May need API endpoint fix or UI refresh
   - Estimated: 5-10 min to complete

CURRENT STATUS
==============

Passing: 171/175 features (97.71%)
Failing: 4 features
- Feature 157: End-to-end workflow (needs folder system - 2-3 hours)
- Feature 158: Multi-conversation project management (THIS SESSION - needs 15-20 min)
- Feature 159: Artifact iteration (needs version history - 1-2 hours)
- Feature 161: Multi-modal interaction (file upload testing challenge)

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

HIGHEST PRIORITY: Complete Feature 158 (15-20 min)
- Very close to passing (75% done)
- Just needs analytics + archive verification
- Would bring us to 172/175 (98.29%)

Alternative Options:
1. Feature 161 (Multi-modal) - Backend ready, test via API
2. Feature 159 (Artifacts) - Most features work, add version history
3. Feature 157 (End-to-end) - Most complex, save for last

SESSION ARTIFACTS
=================

Created Files:
- SESSION-221-SUMMARY.md (comprehensive test documentation)
- SESSION-221-FINAL-STATUS.txt (this file)
- 6 test scripts (.mjs files)

Modified Files:
- claude-progress.txt (updated with Session 221 notes)

Git Commit:
- Commit d9b2c66: "Session 221: Feature 158 testing"
- All changes committed and documented

CONCLUSION
==========

Session 221 made significant progress on Feature 158, demonstrating that the core project management system works well. The project creation, conversation assignment, pinning, and search features all function correctly and look professional.

With just 15-20 more minutes of work to locate the analytics UI and complete archive verification, Feature 158 could be marked as passing, bringing the application to 172/175 features (98.29%).

The application continues to be very close to completion with excellent functionality across almost all features.

Next session should prioritize completing Feature 158 to maximize progress efficiency.
