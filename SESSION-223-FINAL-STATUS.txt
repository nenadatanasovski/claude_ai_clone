FEATURE 159 TESTING RESULTS
============================
Total Steps: 14
Steps Completed: 5 (36%)
Steps Blocked: 2 (version history - Steps 10-11)
Steps Not Tested: 7

✅ WORKING:
- Step 1-2: Start conversation and request HTML artifact
- Step 3: Live preview renders beautifully in iframe
- Step 4: Fullscreen mode expands panel to full window
- Step 5: Exit fullscreen returns to normal size

❌ BLOCKERS:

- Step 11: Compare versions - NOT IMPLEMENTED

⏸️ NOT TESTED:
- Steps 6-9: Artifact editing and versioning
- Step 12: Download
- Steps 13-14: Share functionality

TECHNICAL FINDINGS
==================
Artifact Panel:
- 4 icon buttons: chat, download, fullscreen, close
- Fullscreen button: 3rd button at x=1309, y=95
- Fullscreen state: isArtifactFullscreen variable
- Panel expands to 1388x772 (nearly full window)

Live Preview Quality:
- Renders complete HTML/CSS in iframe
- Beautiful "TechFlow" landing page
- Includes: navigation, hero section, CTA
- Purple gradient background
- Professional appearance

REMAINING WORK
==============
3 Features Still Failing (1.71%):

1. Feature 157 - End-to-end workflow
   Blocker: Folder system not implemented

2. Feature 159 - Artifact iteration
   Blocker: Version history not implemented

3. Feature 161 - Multi-modal
   Blocker: File upload testing (backend ready)

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============
Next Session Priority Order:

1. **Feature 161** (Easiest - 1-2 hours)
   - Backend vision support already exists
   - Just needs file upload UI testing
   - Most likely to complete quickly

2. **Implement Version History** (Medium - 3-4 hours)
   - Would complete Feature 159
   - Requires DB schema + UI components
   - High value feature

3. **Implement Folders** (Harder - 2-3 hours)
   - Would complete Feature 157
   - Requires CRUD + drag-drop
   - Complex UI work

DECISION POINT
==============
Option A: Complete Feature 161 (multi-modal) - quickest win
Option B: Implement version history for Feature 159 - more complete feature
Option C: Implement folders for Feature 157 - most complex

Recommended: Start with Feature 161 (easiest path to 173/175)

FILES CREATED/MODIFIED
======================
- claude-progress.txt (updated)
- session-223-notes.txt (new)
- SESSION-223-FINAL-STATUS.txt (this file)
