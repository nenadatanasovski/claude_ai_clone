FEATURE #132: CODE BLOCK VISUAL STYLING
========================================

**Implementation Summary:**

Added CSS styling to give code blocks rounded corners (8px border-radius), improving the visual polish and professional appearance of code blocks throughout the application.

**Changes Made:**

1. **index.html** - Added CSS in `<style>` section:
   ```css
   /* Code block styling - rounded corners */
   pre code {
     display: block;
     border-radius: 8px;
     overflow-x: auto;
   }

   /* Ensure inline code doesn't get border radius */
   code:not(pre code) {
     border-radius: 4px;
   }
   ```

**Styling Verification Results:**

All code block styling verified programmatically using browser automation:

✅ **Step 1: Generate a message with a code block**
- Sent message: "Write a simple JavaScript function"
- Received response with Python code block
- Code block rendered with syntax highlighting

✅ **Step 2: Verify background color contrasts with message**
- Code background: `#0d1117` (dark gray/black)
- Message background: white/transparent
- Strong contrast verified ✓
- GitHub Dark theme from highlight.js

✅ **Step 3: Verify rounded corners on code block**
- Border radius: `8px` ✓
- Rounded corners clearly visible in screenshots
- Professional, modern appearance
- Matches design system standards

✅ **Step 4: Verify proper padding inside block**
- Padding: `16px` ✓
- Adequate spacing around code content
- Professional appearance maintained
- Code remains readable

✅ **Step 5: Verify monospace font is used**
- Font family: `"JetBrains Mono", Consolas, Monaco, "Courier New", monospace` ✓
- Professional code font ✓
- Excellent readability
- Proper monospace rendering

✅ **Step 6: Verify copy button is styled consistently**
- Copy button found: Yes ✓
- Background: `#374151` (Tailwind gray-700)
- Padding: `4px 8px`
- Border radius: `4px`
- Position: `absolute` (top-right corner)
- Font size: `12px`
- Appears on hover
- Shows "Copied!" confirmation when clicked
- Consistent styling with design system ✓

**Programmatic Verification:**

Used JavaScript in browser to measure actual computed styles:

```javascript
{
  "step2_backgroundColor": "#0d1117",
  "step2_hasContrast": true,
  "step2_PASS": true,
  "step3_borderRadius": "8px",
  "step3_PASS": true,
  "step4_padding": "16px",
  "step4_PASS": true,
  "step5_fontFamily": "\"JetBrains Mono\", Consolas, Monaco, \"Courier New\", monospace",
  "step5_isMonospace": true,
  "step5_PASS": true,
  "copyButton": {
    "found": true,
    "backgroundColor": "#374151",
    "padding": "4px 8px",
    "borderRadius": "4px",
    "position": "absolute",
    "fontSize": "12px"
  },
  "step6_PASS": true
}
```

All checks passed! ✅

**Visual Quality:**

The code blocks now have:
- Smooth rounded corners (8px) - professional appearance
- Dark background with excellent contrast
- Proper padding for readability
- Monospace font (JetBrains Mono) for code clarity
- Syntax highlighting with colors
- Copy button with consistent styling
- Hover effects on copy button
- Modern, polished design matching claude.ai

**Code Quality:**

- Clean CSS implementation
- No JavaScript changes needed (existing CodeBlock component works perfectly)
- Minimal, focused changes
- No side effects on other components
- Follows design system principles
- Maintainable and clear
