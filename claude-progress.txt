FEATURE #45 VERIFICATION DETAILS
=================================

Feature #45 (Theme switching - Dark to Light) was already fully implemented in
Session 45. This session verified it works correctly end-to-end.

**Existing Implementation:**

1. **Theme State Management (line 101 in src/App.jsx):**
   - `const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light')`
   - Supports three modes: 'light', 'dark', 'auto'

2. **Theme Application Logic (lines 151-171):**
   - useEffect hook that applies theme changes
   - Handles 'auto' mode with system preference detection
   - Updates isDark state based on theme selection
   - Listens for system theme changes in auto mode

3. **Settings Modal UI (lines 3204-3290):**
   - Three theme option buttons: Light, Dark, Auto
   - Visual indicators (sun, moon, half-moon icons)
   - Checkmark shows active theme
   - Orange border highlights selected option
   - Proper dark mode styling for all elements

**Testing Methodology:**

Used browser automation with Puppeteer to test the complete workflow:

1. Opened Settings modal
2. Selected Dark theme
3. Verified dark theme applied (black background, light text)
4. Opened Settings again
5. Selected Light theme
6. Verified light theme applied (white background, dark text)

**Test Results:**

✅ Step 1: Set theme to Dark - Successfully switched to dark mode
✅ Step 2: Open settings - Settings modal opened correctly
✅ Step 3: Select 'Light' theme - Light option clicked and selected
✅ Step 4: Background changes to light colors - White background applied
✅ Step 5: All UI elements adapt to light theme - Complete theme transition
