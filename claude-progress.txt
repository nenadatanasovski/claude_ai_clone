TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
========================

**1. State Variables (src/App.jsx, lines 262-263):**
```javascript
const [showCommandPalette, setShowCommandPalette] = useState(false)
const [commandPaletteQuery, setCommandPaletteQuery] = useState('')
```

**2. Keyboard Shortcut Listener (src/App.jsx, lines 379-397):**
- useEffect hook to listen for Cmd+K / Ctrl+K
- Prevents browser default behavior
- Toggles command palette visibility
- Also handles Escape key to close palette
- Cleans up event listener on unmount

**3. Commands List (src/App.jsx, lines 306-419):**
Created 10 command objects, each with:
- id: Unique identifier
- name: Display name
- description: Help text
- icon: Emoji icon
- action: Function to execute

Commands included:
1. New Conversation - Creates new chat
2. Search Conversations - Focuses search input
3. Prompt Library - Opens prompt library modal
4. Example Conversations - Opens examples modal
5. Usage Dashboard - Opens usage dashboard
6. Settings - Opens settings modal
7. Toggle Theme - Switches between light/dark mode
8. New Project - Opens new project modal
9. Export Conversation - Opens export modal (if conversation exists)
10. Share Conversation - Opens share modal (if conversation exists)

**4. Command Palette UI Modal (src/App.jsx, lines 4208-4285):**
- Fixed overlay with semi-transparent backdrop
- Centered modal with max width 2xl
- Search input with magnifying glass icon and auto-focus
- Real-time filtering based on name or description
- Command list with hover states
- Click to execute command
- Enter key to execute first filtered command
- Footer with keyboard shortcut hints (Esc, ⌘K/Ctrl+K)
- Empty state when no commands match search

**5. Enter Key Handler (src/App.jsx, lines 4227-4239):**
- onKeyDown event on search input
- Filters commands based on current query
- Executes first filtered command's action when Enter pressed

VERIFICATION WITH BROWSER AUTOMATION
=====================================

**Screenshots captured:**
1. 06_before_command_palette - Homepage before opening palette
2. 07_command_palette_opened - Palette opened with Cmd+K (all 10 commands visible)
3. 08_command_palette_closed - Palette closed with Escape
4. 09_command_palette_search_new - Search for "new" (filtered to 2 commands)
