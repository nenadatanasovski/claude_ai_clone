TECHNICAL DETAILS
=================

**Frontend Implementation (src/App.jsx):**

1. State Management (lines 427-431):
   ```javascript
   const [showOnboardingTour, setShowOnboardingTour] = useState(() => {
     const completed = localStorage.getItem('onboardingCompleted')
     return !completed // Show tour if not completed
   }) // Onboarding tour visibility
   const [tourStep, setTourStep] = useState(0) // Current step in onboarding tour
   ```

2. Tour Modal Component (lines 7747-8052):
   - Full-screen overlay with backdrop blur
   - Max-width modal (max-w-2xl) with rounded corners
   - Progress bar showing completion percentage
   - 6 distinct content steps
   - Navigation controls at bottom

**UI/UX Features:**

1. **Progress Bar:**
   - Top of modal, 1px height
   - Orange fill showing completion: `((tourStep + 1) / 6) * 100%`
   - Smooth transitions with `transition-all duration-300`

2. **Step Navigation Dots:**
   - 6 dots representing each step
   - Current step: orange, elongated (w-6)
   - Other steps: gray, circular (w-2)
   - Clickable to jump to any step
   - Hover effects for better UX

3. **Button Layout:**
   - Left: Progress dots
   - Right: Action buttons
   - "Skip Tour" (text button, always visible)
   - "Back" (secondary button, visible from step 2+)
   - "Next" (primary orange button, steps 0-4)
   - "Get Started" (primary orange button, step 5)

4. **Visual Design:**
   - Semi-transparent dark backdrop (bg-black/50 backdrop-blur-sm)
   - White modal with shadow (dark mode: dark:bg-gray-900)
   - Emoji icons in colored circular backgrounds
   - Orange accent color (bg-claude-orange)
   - Consistent spacing and typography
   - Responsive padding (p-8, px-8 pb-8)

5. **localStorage Integration:**
   - Key: 'onboardingCompleted'
   - Set to 'true' when:
     * User clicks "Get Started"
     * User clicks "Skip Tour"
   - Checked on component mount
   - Prevents tour from showing again

**How It Works:**

1. User visits app for first time
2. `showOnboardingTour` checks localStorage for 'onboardingCompleted'
3. If not found (first visit), tour displays automatically
4. User can navigate through 6 steps with Next/Back
5. User can jump to specific step by clicking progress dots
6. User can skip tour at any time
7. Completing or skipping sets localStorage flag
8. Tour never shows again for that user
9. Subsequent visits skip tour, show main app

**Files Modified:**
- src/App.jsx: Added onboarding tour state and modal component (310 lines added)
- feature_list.json: Feature #109 marked as passing
- find-next-failing-test.mjs: Helper script created for finding next feature
