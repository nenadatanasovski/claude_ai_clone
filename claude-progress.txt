SESSION 62 - FEATURE #61: EXAMPLE CONVERSATIONS FOR ONBOARDING
===============================================================
Date: December 13, 2025
Agent: Feature Implementation Agent

SUMMARY
=======

Session 62 successfully implemented Feature #61 - Example conversations for onboarding:
- ✅ Created backend API endpoint GET /api/prompts/examples
- ✅ Added 4 pre-made example conversations (Writing, Coding, Education, Productivity)
- ✅ Added Examples button in header UI
- ✅ Implemented modal to display and select example conversations
- ✅ Added functions to load and start example conversations
- ✅ Fixed critical route ordering issue (/:id was catching /examples)
- ✅ API verified working (returns 200 with example data)
- ✅ Code committed successfully

**Progress: 60/175 features passing (34.29%)** - Feature #61 ready for final verification

⚠️ **IMPORTANT for Next Session:**
Feature #61 implementation is COMPLETE but needs final end-to-end verification with screenshots.
The backend API works (confirmed with test script), frontend code is in place.
Browser session was disconnected during testing - needs to be retested with puppeteer.

Next Priority:
1. Reconnect browser and verify Feature #61 end-to-end
2. Mark Feature #61 as passing in feature_list.json
3. Move to Feature #62

TECHNICAL DETAILS
=================

**Backend Implementation (server/server.js):**

Added GET /api/prompts/examples endpoint at line 2033 (BEFORE /:id route at line 2232):
- Returns array of 4 example conversation objects
- Each example includes: id, title, description, category, icon, messages array
- Route ordering is critical: specific routes MUST come before parameterized routes

Example conversations included:
1. Creative Writing Assistant (✍️ Writing) - Robot learning to paint story
2. Code Debugging Help (🐛 Coding) - Python division by zero fix
3. Learning Complex Topics (📚 Education) - Quantum entanglement explanation
4. Planning and Brainstorming (🎯 Productivity) - Career transition plan

**Frontend Implementation (src/App.jsx):**

1. Added state variables (lines 260-261):
   - showExampleConversations: boolean for modal visibility
   - exampleConversations: array to store loaded examples

2. Added loadExampleConversations() function (lines 681-697):
   - Fetches from /api/prompts/examples
   - Sets exampleConversations state
   - Includes console.log debugging statements

3. Added startExampleConversation() function (lines 699-740):
   - Creates new conversation via POST /api/conversations
   - Adds all example messages via POST /api/conversations/:id/messages
   - Marks messages with is_example: true to avoid API calls
   - Switches to new conversation and loads messages
   - Closes modal after creation

4. Added Examples button in header (lines 2356-2371):
   - Icon: book/open-book SVG
   - Calls loadExampleConversations() and setShowExampleConversations(true)
   - Positioned between Prompts and Usage buttons

5. Added Example Conversations modal (lines 3988-4066):
   - Header with title and description
   - Grid layout (2 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile)
   - Each card shows: icon, title, category badge, description, message count
   - Click handler calls startExampleConversation()
   - Close button and X button to dismiss

**Critical Bug Fix:**

PROBLEM: Route `/api/prompts/examples` was returning 404
ROOT CAUSE: Express was matching it to `/api/prompts/:id` route (treating "examples" as an ID)
SOLUTION: Moved `/api/prompts/examples` endpoint registration BEFORE `/api/prompts/:id`
LESSON: In Express, specific routes must always be registered before parameterized routes

**Verification Status:**

✅ Backend API tested with node script:
   - Endpoint responds with status 200
   - Returns 4 example objects with correct structure
   - Confirmed via test-examples-api.mjs script

⏳ Frontend UI needs final verification:
   - Browser disconnected during testing (pkill node killed puppeteer process)
   - Modal code is complete and should work
   - Needs reconnection and screenshot verification

**Git Commits This Session:**
- 004c656: Implement Feature #61: Example conversations for onboarding

**Files Modified:**
- server/server.js: +198 lines (API endpoint)
- src/App.jsx: +164 lines (UI components and functions)

**Test Files Created:**
- test-examples-api.mjs (for manual API testing)
- check-prompts.cjs/js (utility scripts)
