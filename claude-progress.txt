FEATURE #134: ARTIFACT PANEL VISUAL DESIGN
===========================================

**Verification Summary:**

The artifact panel already has professional, polished visual design that meets all test requirements. No implementation changes were needed.

**Test Steps Verified:**

✅ **Step 1: Open an artifact**
- Sent message: "Create a simple HTML page with a blue button that says Click Me"
- Artifact panel opened automatically on the right side
- HTML artifact generated with live preview
- Screenshot: feature134_artifact_opened.png

✅ **Step 2: Verify clean header with title and badges**
- Header displays "ARTIFACT" label in uppercase gray text
- Professional typography with proper font weight and size
- Title shows "HTML 1" in clean, readable font (text-sm font-semibold)
- Badges display "html • html" in gray text beneath title
- Artifact counter shown when multiple artifacts exist (e.g., "1 / 2")
- Clean separation with border-bottom
- Screenshot: feature134_step2_header.png

✅ **Step 3: Verify content area is well-defined**
- Content area clearly separated from header with border
- White background in light mode, dark background in dark mode
- HTML preview renders correctly with live "Click Me!" button
- Well-defined boundaries with proper padding
- Content scrolls independently if needed
- Professional layout matching claude.ai design
- Screenshot: feature134_step3_content_area.png

✅ **Step 4: Verify buttons are clearly visible and styled**
- 4 icon buttons clearly visible in top-right corner:
  1. Comment/edit button (pen icon) - for code artifacts
  2. Re-prompt button (chat bubble icon) - to iterate on artifact
  3. Download button (download arrow icon) - save to file
  4. Fullscreen button (expand icon) - maximize view
  5. Close button (X icon) - close panel
- All buttons have consistent styling:
  - Rounded corners with p-1 padding
  - Hover state: bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800
  - Smooth transition-colors animation
  - Tooltips on hover for accessibility
- Icons are clear SVG graphics with proper sizing (w-5 h-5)
- Proper spacing between buttons (gap-2)
- Screenshot: feature134_step4_button_hover.png

✅ **Step 5: Verify panel has subtle border separating from chat**
- Left border present: `border-l border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800`
- Border color: rgb(229, 231, 235) in light mode
- Subtle but clearly visible separation from chat area
- Not too harsh - perfectly balanced for visual hierarchy
- Extends full height of panel
- Matches overall design system
- Screenshot: feature134_step5_border.png

**Visual Design Quality:**

The artifact panel demonstrates excellent visual design:
- **Header**: Clean hierarchy with label, title, and badges
- **Buttons**: Intuitive icons with clear hover states
- **Border**: Subtle separation without visual clutter
- **Typography**: Consistent with app design language
- **Spacing**: Proper padding and margins throughout
- **Contrast**: Excellent readability in both light and dark modes
- **Responsiveness**: Adapts to fullscreen mode seamlessly

**Code Quality (App.jsx lines 5248-5670):**

```jsx
{/* Artifact Panel */}
{showArtifactPanel && currentArtifact && (
  <aside className={`border-l border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800 flex flex-col bg-white dark:bg-[#1A1A1A] ${
    isArtifactFullscreen ? 'fixed inset-0 z-50 w-full' : 'w-96'
  }`}>
    {/* Artifact Header */}
    <div className="border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800 p-4 flex items-center justify-between">
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
        <div className="text-xs font-semibold text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 uppercase">
          Artifact
        </div>
        {artifacts.length > 1 && (
          <div className="text-xs text-gray-400">
            {artifacts.indexOf(currentArtifact) + 1} / {artifacts.length}
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
        {/* Icon buttons with hover states */}
      </div>
    </div>
    {/* Content area */}
  </aside>
)}
```

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Semantic HTML with `<aside>` element
- Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
- Proper component structure with clear separation
- Dark mode support with `dark:` variants
- Accessibility features (ARIA, tooltips)
- Responsive design (fixed width or fullscreen)
- Clean, maintainable code

**Why This Matters:**

The artifact panel is a core feature of the Claude.ai experience. Excellent visual design ensures:
- Users can easily identify and interact with artifacts
- Clear hierarchy helps users understand the interface
- Professional appearance builds user confidence
- Consistent styling creates a cohesive experience
- Accessible design serves all users effectively
