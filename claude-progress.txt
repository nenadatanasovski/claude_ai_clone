FEATURE #23 IMPLEMENTATION
===========================

**Feature #23: Move Conversation to a Project** ✅ COMPLETE

Backend Changes:
----------------
Updated server/server.js:
- Modified PUT /api/conversations/:id endpoint (line 525)
- Added support for project_id field in request body
- Backend now accepts project_id updates alongside title, is_archived, is_pinned, model

Frontend Changes:
-----------------
Updated src/App.jsx:

1. Added state variables (lines 72-73):
   - showMoveToProjectModal
   - moveConversationId

2. Added functions (lines 678-707):
   - openMoveToProjectModal() - opens modal and stores conversation ID
   - closeMoveToProjectModal() - closes modal and clears state
   - moveConversationToProject(projectId) - calls API to update conversation

3. Added context menu option (lines 1269-1278):
   - "Move to Project" button with 📁 folder icon
   - Positioned between Duplicate and Export options
   - Opens move to project modal on click

4. Added Move to Project Modal (lines 1360-1408):
   - Modal with title "Move to Project"
   - "All Conversations" option (sets project_id to null)
   - List of all projects with:
     * Color indicator (small colored circle)
     * Project name
     * Project description (if available)
   - Cancel button
   - Clicking project moves conversation and closes modal

5. Added project filtering (lines 120-123, 934, 937, 942, 999, 1004):
   - useEffect to reload conversations when currentProjectId changes
   - Filter logic: (currentProjectId === null || c.project_id === currentProjectId)
   - Applied to both pinned and regular conversation lists
   - Shows all conversations when "All Conversations" selected
   - Shows only project conversations when specific project selected

Testing & Verification:
-----------------------
✅ Step 1: Create a project
   - Used existing "Test Project 2" from Feature #22

✅ Step 2: Create a conversation
   - Used existing "New Chat (Copy)" conversation

✅ Step 3: Right-click on the conversation
   - Right-clicked "New Chat (Copy)"
   - Context menu appeared with all options

✅ Step 4: Select 'Move to Project'
   - Clicked "Move to Project" (📁 icon)
   - Modal appeared correctly

✅ Step 5: Choose the created project
   - Modal showed:
     * All Conversations - Remove from project
     * Test Project 2 (blue dot) - A test project for verification testing
     * Test Project (orange dot) - This is a test project for Feature #22
   - Clicked "Test Project 2"

✅ Step 6: Switch to the project view
   - Clicked project selector dropdown
   - Selected "Test Project 2"
   - Project selector updated to show "Test Project 2"

✅ Step 7: Verify the conversation appears in that project
   - Sidebar filtered to show only Test Project 2 conversations
   - "New Chat (Copy)" appears under Conversations section
   - Filtering working correctly
   - Verified by switching back to "All Conversations" and seeing all conversations
