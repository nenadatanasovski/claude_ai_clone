SESSION 92 - FEATURE #100: LAST MESSAGE TIMESTAMP DISPLAY
==========================================================
Date: December 13, 2025
Agent: Feature Implementation Agent

SUMMARY
=======

Session 92 focused on implementing Feature #100: Last message timestamp display

**Server Recovery:**
- ✅ Fixed crashed backend server (was showing EADDRINUSE errors)
- ✅ Killed old node processes and restarted backend on port 3001
- ✅ Restarted frontend vite server on port 5173
- ✅ Both servers running successfully

**Feature #100 Implementation (COMPLETE):**
- ✅ Added `formatRelativeTime()` helper function to format timestamps
- ✅ Formats timestamps as: "Just now", "X minutes ago", "X hours ago", "Yesterday", "X days ago", etc.
- ✅ Updated conversation list UI to display timestamps below titles
- ✅ Applied to both pinned and regular conversations
- ✅ Uses existing `last_message_at` field from backend (no DB changes needed)
- ✅ Styled with smaller gray text for visual hierarchy
- ✅ Code committed: 794602a

**Puppeteer Connection Issue:**
- ❌ Browser automation testing blocked by detached frame error
- Chrome debug instance running on port 9222 but puppeteer can't reconnect
- Frame '5877877FFD55B03D9D7FB99439DBB261' is detached
- Cannot use connect_active_tab tool (requires permission)
- Created test-feature-100.md with manual testing steps

**Progress: 99/175 features (56.57%) - Feature #100 code complete, testing pending**

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
======================

Added formatRelativeTime() function that provides human-readable timestamps:
- < 60 seconds: "Just now"
- < 60 minutes: "X minutes ago"
- < 24 hours: "X hours ago"
- 1 day: "Yesterday"
- < 7 days: "X days ago"
- < 30 days: "X weeks ago"
- < 365 days: "X months ago"
- >= 365 days: "X years ago"

Updated conversation rendering in two locations:
1. Pinned conversations section
2. Regular conversations grouped by date

Changes applied:
- Changed layout from flex-row to flex-col to stack title and timestamp
- Added timestamp display below title when last_message_at exists
- Styled with text-xs and gray color for subtle appearance

KNOWN ISSUES
============
- Puppeteer MCP server connection is detached - cannot perform automated browser testing
- Feature implementation is complete but needs visual verification
- Servers are running and code is deployed

NEXT STEPS
==========
1. **CRITICAL**: Fix puppeteer connection or manually verify Feature #100 works visually
2. If Feature #100 verified: Mark as passing and update feature_list.json
3. Continue with Feature #101: User profile display
4. 76 features remaining after #100 is verified

TESTING REQUIRED FOR FEATURE #100
==================================
See test-feature-100.md for detailed test plan. Quick checks needed:
- View conversation list - timestamps should appear below each title
- Send new message - timestamp should update to "Just now"
- Verify timestamp format matches expected patterns
- Check both pinned and regular conversations show timestamps
