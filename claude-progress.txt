FEATURE #135: MODAL/OVERLAY VISUAL DESIGN
==========================================

**Verification Summary:**

The modal system already has professional, polished visual design that meets all test requirements. The Settings modal was used as the test case. No implementation changes were needed.

**Test Steps Verified:**

✅ **Step 1: Open a modal (e.g., settings)**
- Clicked Settings button in top navigation
- Settings modal opened successfully
- Modal displayed over existing content
- Screenshot: feature135_step1_settings_modal.png

✅ **Step 2: Verify semi-transparent backdrop**
- Backdrop class: `fixed inset-0 bg-black/50`
- Semi-transparent black overlay covers entire screen
- Background content visible but dimmed
- Creates clear visual hierarchy and focus
- Backdrop prevents interaction with content behind modal
- Screenshot: feature135_step2_backdrop.png

✅ **Step 3: Verify modal is centered and elevated**
- Modal container uses: `flex items-center justify-center`
- Perfectly centered both vertically and horizontally
- High z-index: `z-50` ensures modal appears above all content
- Modal content styling:
  - `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800` - clean background
  - `rounded-lg` - rounded corners (8px)
  - `p-6` - generous padding
  - `max-w-2xl` - constrained width for readability
  - `max-h-[90vh]` - scrollable if content is long
- `animate-fadeIn` on backdrop for smooth appearance
- `animate-slideIn` on content for elegant entrance
- Screenshot: feature135_step3_centered.png

✅ **Step 4: Verify clear close button**
- "Done" button clearly visible at bottom of modal
- Button styling: `bg-claude-orange hover:bg-claude-orange-hover`
- White text on orange background for high contrast
- Rounded corners: `rounded-lg`
- Proper padding: `px-4 py-2`
- Smooth transition on hover
- Clear, action-oriented label ("Done")
- Screenshot: feature135_step4_close_button.png

✅ **Step 5: Verify consistent styling with rest of app**
- Uses same color palette as rest of application
- Claude orange (`#CC785C`) for primary actions
- White background in light mode, gray-800 in dark mode
- Consistent border radius (rounded-lg)
- Typography matches app's font stack
- Proper dark mode support with `dark:` variants
- Spacing and padding consistent with design system
- All interactive elements have proper hover states
- Screenshot: feature135_step5_consistent_styling.png

**Implementation Details (App.jsx line 6633):**

```jsx
{/* Settings Modal */}
{showSettingsModal && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50 flex items-center justify-center z-50 animate-fadeIn">
    <div ref={settingsModalRef} className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-6 max-w-2xl w-full mx-4 max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto animate-slideIn">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Settings</h2>
      {/* Modal content */}
      <div className="flex justify-end gap-3 mt-6">
        <button
          onClick={() => setShowSettingsModal(false)}
          className="px-4 py-2 bg-claude-orange hover:bg-claude-orange-hover
            text-white rounded-lg transition-colors"
        >
          Done
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

**Visual Design Quality:**

The modal system demonstrates excellent visual design:
- **Backdrop**: Semi-transparent black (50% opacity) creates clear focus
- **Centering**: Flexbox centers modal perfectly in viewport
- **Elevation**: z-50 ensures modal appears above all content
- **Styling**: Clean white/dark background with rounded corners
- **Animation**: Smooth fade-in and slide-in animations
- **Accessibility**: Clear close button with descriptive label
- **Responsiveness**: Modal adapts to screen size with mx-4 margins
- **Scrolling**: Long content scrolls within modal, not full page
- **Consistency**: Uses app's design tokens and color palette

**Why This Matters:**

Well-designed modals are critical for user experience because they:
- Draw attention to important actions and information
- Prevent accidental interactions with background content
- Provide clear paths for task completion
- Maintain visual consistency with the application
- Create professional, polished user experience

    isArtifactFullscreen ? 'fixed inset-0 z-50 w-full' : 'w-96'
  }`}>
    {/* Artifact Header */}
    <div className="border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800 p-4 flex items-center justify-between">
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
        <div className="text-xs font-semibold text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 uppercase">
          Artifact
        </div>
        {artifacts.length > 1 && (
          <div className="text-xs text-gray-400">
            {artifacts.indexOf(currentArtifact) + 1} / {artifacts.length}
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
