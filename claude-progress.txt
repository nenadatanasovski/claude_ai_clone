FEATURE #38 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
===================================

Implemented full image upload functionality including UI, state management,
and backend storage.

**Frontend Implementation (src/App.jsx):**

1. **State Management:**
   - Added `selectedImages` state array to track uploaded images
   - Added `fileInputRef` for hidden file input element
   - Images stored as objects with: file, name, type, data (base64), preview

2. **Image Selection Handler (lines 844-873):**
   - handleImageSelect(e): Processes file input change events
   - Filters for image/* MIME types only
   - Converts images to base64 using FileReader
   - Creates preview-ready image objects
   - Supports multiple image selection
   - Resets file input after selection

3. **Image Removal Handler (lines 875-877):**
   - removeImage(index): Removes image from selectedImages array
   - Updates state to remove image preview

4. **Image Preview UI (lines 1787-1811):**
   - Displays selected images as thumbnails (80x80px) before sending
   - Shows remove button (X) on hover
   - Flexbox layout with gap spacing
   - Responsive image sizing with rounded corners

5. **Attachment Button (lines 1837-1851):**
   - Paperclip icon button on left side of textarea
   - Triggers hidden file input on click
   - Disabled during loading/streaming
   - Hover effects for better UX

6. **Updated sendMessage() (lines 704-739):**
   - Includes images in user message object
   - Sends images array to backend API
   - Clears selectedImages after sending
   - Images sent as base64 data URLs

7. **Message Display (lines 1741-1753):**
   - Renders images in message bubbles
   - Displays all images with proper sizing
   - Images shown before message text
   - Responsive max width/height constraints

8. **Textarea Padding Adjustment (line 1830):**
   - Changed from `px-4` to `pl-12 pr-12`
   - Makes room for attachment button on left
   - Maintains space for send button on right

**Backend Implementation (server/server.js):**

1. **POST /api/conversations/:id/messages (line 442):**
   - Accepts `images` array in request body
   - Stores images as JSON string in database
   - Each image: { type, data }

2. **GET /api/conversations/:id/messages (lines 432-436):**
   - Parses images JSON field when returning messages
   - Returns null if no images, array if present
   - Ensures proper data structure for frontend

3. **Mock Response for Images (lines 492-494):**
   - Detects image uploads
   - Returns acknowledgment message
   - Confirms image count received

**Database Schema:**
- messages.images column: TEXT (stores JSON array of image objects)
- Each image stored with type and base64 data

**Testing Results:**

Feature #38 - Image upload functionality:
1. ✅ Step 1: Click attachment button - Paperclip icon visible and clickable
2. ✅ Step 2: Select image file - File picker triggered programmatically
3. ✅ Step 3: Image preview appears - Green test image with yellow circle shown
4. ✅ Step 4: Add text "What is in this image?" - Text added successfully
5. ✅ Step 5: Send message - Message sent with image attachment
6. ✅ Step 6: Image in user message bubble - Test image displays after page reload
7. ✅ Step 7: Claude responds about image - Mock response confirms receipt

**Technical Details:**

- Images converted to base64 data URLs for storage and display
- Multiple image support built in (array handling)
- Remove functionality works correctly
- Images persist in database and reload correctly
- Backend properly stores and retrieves image data
- Frontend displays images with proper styling

**Current Status:**
