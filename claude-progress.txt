==============================================================
Date: December 14, 2025, 1:45 PM
Status: PARTIAL - Feature 159 tested 5/14 steps, version history blocking completion
Progress: **172/175 features (98.29%)** - UNCHANGED from Session 222

SUMMARY
=======

Session 223 tested Feature 159 (Comprehensive workflow - artifact iteration and collaboration) and found that 5 out of 14 steps are working correctly, but the feature cannot be marked as passing due to missing version history functionality (Steps 10-11).

**Key Accomplishments:**
- ✅ Mandatory verification test PASSED (Feature #1 - Basic chat working perfectly)
- ✅ **ARTIFACT CREATION WORKS**: Successfully created HTML landing page artifact
- ✅ **LIVE PREVIEW WORKS**: Beautiful TechFlow landing page renders in iframe
- ✅ **FULLSCREEN TOGGLE WORKS**: Can expand/collapse artifact panel
- ❌ **VERSION HISTORY MISSING**: Cannot complete Steps 10-11 (blocking feature completion)

**Testing Results (5/14 steps working - 36%):**

✅ **Steps 1-5 COMPLETE:**
1. Start conversation - WORKS
2. Request 'Create a landing page with HTML and CSS' - WORKS
3. Verify HTML artifact appears with live preview - WORKS
   - Artifact panel displays on right side
   - Live preview shows "TechFlow" landing page
   - Includes: hero section, navigation menu, CTA button
4. View full-screen preview - WORKS
   - Fullscreen button identified and clicked
   - Panel expands to nearly full window (1388x772 out of 1400x900)
5. Exit full-screen - WORKS
   - Toggle works correctly

- Fullscreen state managed by `isArtifactFullscreen` variable

**Live Preview:**
- Renders in iframe element
- Shows complete HTML/CSS output
- Tested landing page includes:
  - Purple gradient background
  - "TechFlow" branding
  - Navigation: Home, Features, About, Contact
  - Hero headline: "Welcome to the Future"
  - Subtext: "Innovative solutions..."
  - CTA button: "Get Started Today"

**Version History Status:**
- Feature NOT implemented (confirmed from previous session notes)
- Blocks completion of Steps 10-11
- Prevents Feature 159 from passing

**Current Status:**

**Before Session 223:** 172/175 features passing (98.29%)
**After Session 223:** 172/175 features passing (98.29%) - NO CHANGE

**Feature 159 Status:** CANNOT PASS (version history not implemented)

**Remaining Failing Features (3):**
- Feature 157: Comprehensive end-to-end workflow (needs folder system)
- Feature 159: Artifact iteration and collaboration (**version history missing**)
- Feature 161: Multi-modal interaction (file upload testing challenging)

**Progress Summary:**
- Total features: 175
- Passing: 172 (98.29%)
- Failing: 3 (1.71%)
- **Only 3 features remaining!**

**Recommendations for Next Session:**

1. **Implement Version History** (Estimated: 3-4 hours)
   - Required for Feature 159 completion
   - Needs: artifact version tracking in database
   - Needs: version selector UI component
   - Needs: version comparison view

2. **Feature 161 - Multi-modal** (Estimated: 1-2 hours)
   - Backend already supports vision/images
   - Just needs file upload UI testing
   - Might be completable without new implementation

3. **Feature 157 - Folders** (Estimated: 2-3 hours)
   - Requires folder CRUD implementation
   - Folder UI in sidebar
   - Drag-and-drop organization

**Session 223 Outcome:**
- Good progress on understanding artifact features
- Identified exact blocking issue (version history)
- All basic artifact features work well
- Need to decide: implement version history OR document as limitation
