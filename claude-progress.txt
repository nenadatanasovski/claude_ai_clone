6. **UI Navigation**: Verified all UI components work correctly through browser automation

**Implementation Details:**
- Command palette (Cmd+K) works for quick actions like creating projects
- Project settings modal accessed via gear icon that appears on hover in project dropdown
- Artifact panel shows multiple artifacts with tabs (Code 1, Code 2, Code 3)
- Artifact toolbar includes: Edit, Comment, Download, Fullscreen, Close buttons
- Re-prompting updates artifacts seamlessly
- Token count: 4,056 / 200,000 after generating artifacts

**Remaining Steps for Feature 157 (5/16):**
- Step 12: Rename conversation to 'CSV Processor'
- Step 13: Create folder 'Python Scripts'
- Step 14: Move conversation into folder
- Step 15: Export conversation to Markdown
- Step 16: Final verification

**Technical Notes:**
- Browser automation successfully navigated entire workflow
- All screenshots captured to verify visual appearance
- Project system fully functional with custom instructions
- Artifact system working perfectly with proper detection and rendering
- No console errors or visual issues detected

**Progress: 169/175 features (96.57%)**
**Feature 157:** 11/16 steps completed (68.75%)

Next Session Priority: Complete remaining Feature 157 steps (rename, folders, export)
