Status: SUCCESSFUL - Vision support implemented, no regressions
Progress: **171/175 features (97.71%)**

SUMMARY
=======

Session 220 successfully implemented backend support for vision/multi-modal interactions by adding proper image handling to the Anthropic API integration. The frontend already had image upload UI components, and this session completed the backend integration to properly format and send images to Claude's vision API.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- ✅ Mandatory verification test PASSED (Feature #1 - Basic chat working)
- ✅ Implemented vision/multi-modal support in backend
- ✅ Modified server.js to include images in API calls
- ✅ Proper image formatting with content blocks for Anthropic API
- ✅ Verified no regressions - chat and artifacts still work perfectly
- ✅ Committed all changes with comprehensive documentation

**Technical Implementation:**

1. **Backend Image Support Added (server/server.js lines 1013-1074):**
   - Modified conversation history query to include `images` column
   - Added image parsing from JSON stored in database
   - Implemented proper content block formatting for Anthropic API
   - Images converted from data URLs to base64 format
   - Support for multiple formats: PNG, JPEG, JPG, GIF, WebP

2. **Message Format Structure:**
   ```javascript
   // Messages with images use content blocks:
   {
     role: 'user',
     content: [
       {
         type: 'image',
         source: {
           type: 'base64',
           media_type: 'image/png',
           data: '<base64-data>'
         }
       },
       {
         type: 'text',
         text: 'Analyze this image'
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Frontend Already Complete:**
   - Image upload button exists (paperclip icon)
   - File input with `accept="image/*"` and `multiple` support
   - `handleImageSelect` function converts images to base64
   - Images stored in `selectedImages` state
   - Images sent to backend in POST /api/conversations/:id/messages

**Testing Results:**

✅ **Mandatory Verification Test (Feature #1):**
- Navigated to app homepage
- Sent message "Hello, can you help me?"
- Received proper streaming response from Claude
- All UI elements working correctly

✅ **Post-Implementation Regression Test:**
- Sent message "Write a simple Python function to add two numbers"
- Received code response with proper formatting
- Code artifacts rendered correctly (showing 2 artifacts)
- Artifact panel working with tabs
- Syntax highlighting working
- Token count displayed (226/200,000)
- No errors in console

**Infrastructure Improvements:**
- ✅ Backend now supports vision API
- ✅ Images properly formatted for Claude API
- ✅ Multi-modal messages ready for testing
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

**Recommendations for Next Session:**

1. **Test Feature 161 (Multi-modal):**
   - Backend is now ready for image uploads
   - Frontend UI already exists
   - Need to test with actual image uploads
   - Can use manual testing or alternative automation approach

2. **Alternative Approaches for File Upload Testing:**
   - Use database insertion to create test messages with images
   - Test via API directly with curl/fetch
   - Create integration test script

3. **Other Failing Features:**
   - Feature 157: Most complex, requires folder system (2-3 hours)
   - Feature 158: Project management testing (45 min - 1 hour)
   - Feature 159: Artifact version history (1-2 hours)

**Session Impact:**
- Major infrastructure improvement for vision/multi-modal support
- Foundation laid for Feature 161 completion
- No regressions introduced

Status: PARTIAL - Servers restarted successfully, browser automation unavailable
Progress: **171/175 features (97.71%)**

SUMMARY
=======

Session 219 focused on restarting the development environment after servers were stopped. Successfully restarted both frontend and backend servers, but encountered browser automation connectivity issues that prevented feature testing.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- ✅ Backend server successfully restarted on port 3001
- ✅ Frontend server successfully restarted on port 5173
- ✅ Verified backend API is working (142 conversations in database)
- ✅ Identified 4 remaining failing features
- ⚠️ Browser automation (Puppeteer) connection lost - could not perform UI testing

**Session Activities:**

1. **Environment Status Check:**
   - Found frontend running on port 5173
   - Found backend NOT running on port 3001
   - Identified stale nodemon process

2. **Server Restart Process:**
   - Cleaned up stale node processes using `pkill node`
   - Started backend server: `npm --prefix server run dev`
   - Started frontend server: `npm run dev`
   - Both servers confirmed running successfully

3. **Backend Verification:**
   - Created test script (test-api-working.mjs) using Node.js native fetch
   - Confirmed backend API responding: `http://localhost:3001/api/conversations`
   - Database contains 142 conversations from previous sessions
   - Anthropic API key loaded successfully

4. **Feature Analysis:**
   - Identified 4 failing features (out of 175 total):
     * Feature 157: Comprehensive end-to-end workflow (16 steps) - needs folder system
     * Feature 158: Multi-conversation project management (12 steps)
     * Feature 159: Artifact iteration and collaboration (14 steps)
     * Feature 161: Multi-modal interaction / image upload (12 steps)

**Technical Issues:**

1. **Puppeteer Connection Lost:**
   - Previous browser session disconnected when node processes were killed
   - Attempted to reconnect but received "detached Frame" error
   - Cannot use browser automation without active connection
   - Instructions specify not to use "active tab" tool

2. **Impact:**
   - Cannot perform mandatory verification test with browser UI
   - Cannot test or implement new features without browser automation
   - Cannot mark features as passing without visual verification

**Current Status:**

**Before Session 219:** 171/175 features passing (97.71%)
**After Session 219:** 171/175 features passing (97.71%) - NO CHANGE

**No features completed** - Browser automation required for testing

**Remaining Failing Features (4):**
- Feature 157: Comprehensive end-to-end workflow (needs folder system)
- Feature 158: Multi-conversation project management
- Feature 159: Artifact iteration and collaboration
- Feature 161: Multi-modal interaction (image upload)

**Recommendations for Next Session:**

1. **Establish Browser Connection First:**
   - Ensure browser automation (Puppeteer) is connected before starting work
   - Consider opening browser manually if needed
   - Verify browser automation works with simple navigation test

2. **Priority Feature Selection:**
   - **Feature 161 (Multi-modal)** - Likely easiest, check if image upload already works
   - **Feature 159 (Artifacts)** - Most artifact features working, needs version history
   - **Feature 158 (Projects)** - Most features implemented, needs testing
   - **Feature 157 (End-to-end)** - Most complex, requires folder system implementation

3. **Testing Approach:**
   - Use browser automation tools (puppeteer_navigate, puppeteer_click, puppeteer_fill, puppeteer_screenshot)
   - Take screenshots at each step for documentation
   - Verify both functional and visual aspects

**Session Artifacts:**
- test-api-working.mjs - Script to verify backend API connectivity
- show-failing-features.mjs - Script to display failing features with details

**Feature 162 Status:**

✅ **WORKING FEATURES:**
- Cmd+K opens command palette
- Command palette filtering works
- Enter selects commands in palette
- New conversation creation via keyboard
- Message sending with Enter
- Settings modal opens from command palette
- **Esc closes Settings modal (NEW FIX!)**

❌ **STILL MISSING FEATURES:**
- Arrow key navigation with visual highlighting in command palette
- Arrow key navigation in sidebar conversations
- Enter to open selected conversation from sidebar
- Tab navigation within Settings modal (not tested)

**Recommendation:**

Feature 162 should remain marked as **"passes": false** because:
- Arrow key navigation features not implemented
- Sidebar keyboard navigation missing
- Only partial keyboard power user functionality

However, this session made significant progress by fixing the critical Esc key bug!

**Progress: 169/175 features (96.57%)**
**Feature 162:** Still failing, but improved with Esc key fix

Next Session Priority:
1. Implement arrow key navigation with visual highlighting in command palette
2. Implement arrow key navigation in sidebar conversation list
3. OR work on other failing features (157-161) which may be easier to complete
