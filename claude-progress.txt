**Frontend Implementation (Session 27):**
- State: folders, expandedFolders (Set), showFolderModal, newFolderName, contextMenuType ✅
- Functions: loadFolders(), createFolder(), toggleFolder() ✅
- Context menu: handleSidebarContextMenu() distinguishes sidebar vs conversation clicks ✅
- UI: Folders section with expand/collapse ✅
- Modal: Create folder with keyboard shortcuts (Enter to submit, Escape to cancel) ✅

VITE HMR ISSUE RESOLUTION
===========================

**Issue from Session 27:**
Vite's Hot Module Replacement was caching old App.jsx with JSX errors.

**Resolution:**
Restarted servers by running `./init.sh` which cleared the cache.
Feature #25 worked immediately after restart, confirming the code was correct.
