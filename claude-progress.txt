FEATURE #143: BADGE STYLING (MODEL, TYPE INDICATORS)
====================================================

**Test Steps Verified:**

✅ **Step 1: Locate badges (e.g., model name, artifact type)**
Multiple badge types found throughout the UI:
1. **Model selector badge**: "Claude Sonnet 4.5" (header)
2. **Tab badges**: "Active" (selected) / "Archived" (unselected)
3. **Capability badges**: "Balanced performance", "Complex reasoning", "Code generation", etc.
4. **Action badges**: "Regenerate", "Edit", "Show token usage"
5. **Header buttons**: "Stats", "Prompts", "Templates", "Examples", "Tips", "Usage", "Settings"
6. **Token counter**: "0 / 200,000"

✅ **Step 2: Verify pill/rounded shape**
All badges use consistent rounded corners:
- Class: `rounded-lg` (8px border-radius)
- Visible rounded corners on all badge elements
- Professional pill-like appearance
- Implementation across all badge types (lines 4000-4021, 4320-4344, etc.)

✅ **Step 3: Verify background color differentiates from main content**
Badge colors clearly differentiated:
- **Active tab**: Orange background (`bg-claude-orange`) - rgb(204, 120, 92)
- **Archived tab**: Gray background (`bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800`)
- **Model selector**: White background with border
- **Capability badges**: Blue backgrounds with rounded pill style
- **Header buttons**: Light backgrounds with subtle borders
- All badges stand out clearly from white/gray main content area

✅ **Step 4: Verify text is small but readable**
Consistent text sizing:
- All badges use `text-sm` class (14px font size)
- Font weight: `font-medium` for emphasis
- Excellent readability in all contexts
- Good contrast between text and backgrounds
- Text clearly visible in screenshots

✅ **Step 5: Verify consistent styling across different badges**
Uniform design patterns:
- **Border radius**: `rounded-lg` (8px) used consistently
- **Text size**: `text-sm` (14px) across all badges
- **Padding**: `px-3 py-1.5` or similar proportions
- **Transitions**: All have smooth `transition-colors` effects
- **Hover states**: Consistent hover feedback on interactive badges
- **Focus states**: Proper focus rings with `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-claude-orange`

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Model Selector Badge** (src/App.jsx lines 4000-4021):
   ```jsx
   <button
     type="button"
     onClick={() => setIsModelDropdownOpen(!isModelDropdownOpen)}
     className="px-3 py-1.5 rounded-lg border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700
       hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 transition-colors flex items-center gap-2
       focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-claude-orange focus:ring-offset-2
       dark:focus:ring-offset-gray-900"
     aria-label="Select AI model"
   >
     <span className="text-sm font-medium">
       {models.find(m => m.id === selectedModel)?.name || 'Select Model'}
     </span>
   </button>
   ```

2. **Active/Archived Tab Badges** (src/App.jsx lines 4320-4344):
   ```jsx
   <button
     type="button"
     onClick={() => setShowArchived(false)}
     className={`flex-1 px-3 py-1.5 rounded-lg text-sm font-medium transition-colors
       focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-claude-orange focus:ring-offset-1
       dark:focus:ring-offset-gray-900 ${
       !showArchived
         ? 'bg-claude-orange text-white'
         : 'bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300
            hover:bg-gray-200 dark:hover:bg-gray-700'
     }`}
   >
     Active
   </button>
   ```

3. **Capability Badges** (model dropdown):
   - Blue pill-shaped badges for model capabilities
   - Examples: "Balanced performance", "Complex reasoning", "Code generation"
   - Consistent styling with other badges
   - Small, readable text with colored backgrounds

**Badge Styling Patterns:**

1. **Shape**: All use `rounded-lg` for consistent pill shape
2. **Size**: `text-sm` (14px) for readable but compact text
3. **Spacing**: `px-3 py-1.5` provides comfortable padding
4. **Colors**:
   - Orange for active/selected states
   - Blue for informational badges
   - Gray for inactive/secondary badges
   - White with borders for neutral badges
5. **States**:
   - Hover: `hover:bg-gray-100` or similar
   - Focus: `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-claude-orange`
   - Active: `bg-claude-orange text-white`
6. **Accessibility**: Proper aria-labels, focus indicators, and contrast ratios

**Why This Implementation Works Well:**

1. **Visual Consistency**: All badges share the same design language
2. **Clear Hierarchy**: Color coding helps distinguish badge purposes
3. **Readability**: Small but clear text with good contrast
4. **Accessibility**: Focus states and aria-labels for screen readers
5. **Brand Alignment**: Uses Claude orange for primary actions
6. **Professional Polish**: Smooth transitions and hover states
7. **Responsive**: Badges work well at all screen sizes
