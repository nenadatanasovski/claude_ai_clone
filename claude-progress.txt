PROJECT STATUS:
===============

FOUNDATION: Complete ✅
- Git repository initialized
- Project structure created
- Frontend skeleton working
- Backend server functional
- Database schema implemented
- Basic UI components in place

NEXT STEPS FOR SESSION 2:
==========================

The next agent should focus on implementing core chat functionality:

Priority 1 - Basic Chat (Feature #1-12 from feature_list.json):
1. Connect frontend to backend API
2. Implement actual message sending
3. Add streaming response handling with SSE
4. Create proper message display components
5. Add markdown rendering
6. Implement code block syntax highlighting
7. Add auto-resize textarea
8. Implement keyboard shortcuts (Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline)
9. Add loading states and typing indicators
10. Implement stop generation button

Priority 2 - Conversation Management (Feature #13-27):
1. Implement conversation list loading from database
2. Add conversation creation
3. Add conversation switching
4. Implement conversation rename
5. Add delete with confirmation
6. Implement conversation search
7. Add date-based grouping (Today, Yesterday, etc.)

These are the most fundamental features that everything else builds upon.

TESTING CHECKLIST:
==================
Before marking features as passing, ensure:
- Feature works as described in feature_list.json
- All steps in the test can be completed successfully
- Error handling is in place
- UI provides clear feedback
- Changes are committed to git

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
====================
- NEVER remove or edit features in feature_list.json
- ONLY mark features as passing when fully implemented and tested
- Work on ONE feature at a time
- Test thoroughly before marking "passes": true
- Commit progress frequently with descriptive messages
- Update this progress file at end of each session

FILES CREATED THIS SESSION:
============================
- feature_list.json (200 test cases)
- init.sh (setup script)
- README.md (project documentation)
- .gitignore
- package.json (frontend)
- vite.config.js
- index.html
- src/main.jsx
- src/App.jsx
- src/index.css
- server/package.json
- server/server.js
- .env (environment config)

CURRENT STATE:
==============
- Application structure is ready
- Database is set up
- Basic UI is visible
- Backend API is functional
- Ready for feature implementation

The foundation is solid. The next agent can begin implementing features
from the feature_list.json, starting with the most fundamental chat
functionality.
