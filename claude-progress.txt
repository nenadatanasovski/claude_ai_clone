TECHNICAL DETAILS
=================

**Frontend Implementation (src/App.jsx):**

1. State Management (lines 372-378):
   ```javascript
   const [showTipsModal, setShowTipsModal] = useState(false) // Show tips modal
   const [tips, setTips] = useState([]) // All tips organized by category
   const [selectedTipCategory, setSelectedTipCategory] = useState('All') // Selected tip category filter
   const [readTips, setReadTips] = useState(() => {
     const saved = localStorage.getItem('readTips')
     return saved ? JSON.parse(saved) : []
   }) // Array of tip IDs that have been marked as read
   ```

2. Tips Data Structure (20 tips total):
   - **Getting Started** (3 tips): Use Clear Prompts, Provide Context, Break Down Tasks
   - **Productivity** (4 tips): Keyboard Shortcuts, Organize with Projects, Save Prompts, Use Templates

   - **Writing & Content** (3 tips): Specify Tone, Provide Examples, Ask for Multiple Versions
   - **Advanced Features** (3 tips): Adjust Model Settings, Custom Instructions, Track Usage

3. Tip Object Structure:
   ```javascript
   {
     id: 1,
     category: 'Getting Started',
     title: 'Use Clear and Specific Prompts',
     content: 'The more specific your prompt, the better the response. Instead of "Write code," try "Write a Python function that calculates factorial."',
     actionable: 'Be specific in your requests'
   }
   ```

4. Key Functions:
   - `loadTips()`: Loads all 20 tips into state
