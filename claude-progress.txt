VERIFICATION DETAILS
====================

**Color Implementation:**

From App.jsx analysis, the light mode uses:

1. **Main Background:**
   - Class: `bg-white dark:bg-[#1A1A1A]`
   - Light mode color: #FFFFFF (pure white)
   - Location: Line 3773

2. **Surface Elements:**
   - Sidebar background: Implicit light gray from browser defaults
   - User message bubbles: `bg-gray-100` (#F3F4F6)
   - Typing indicator: `bg-gray-50` (#F9FAFB)
   - Hover states: `bg-gray-50` and `bg-gray-100`
   - Cards/surfaces: `bg-gray-50` (#F9FAFB)

3. **Text Colors:**
   - Primary text: `text-gray-900` (#111827 - near black)
   - Secondary text: `text-gray-600` (#4B5563)
   - Tertiary/hints: `text-gray-500` (#6B7280)

4. **Borders:**
   - Header border: `border-gray-200` (#E5E7EB)
   - Input borders: `border-gray-300` (#D1D5DB)

**Tailwind Color Reference:**

The implementation uses standard Tailwind CSS colors:
- `bg-white`: #FFFFFF (pure white)
- `bg-gray-50`: #F9FAFB (very light gray, almost white)
- `bg-gray-100`: #F3F4F6 (light gray)
- `bg-gray-200`: #E5E7EB (borders)
- `text-gray-900`: #111827 (near black, excellent contrast)
- `text-gray-600`: #4B5563 (secondary text)

These colors provide excellent contrast ratios and readability.

- Text uses `text-gray-900` for excellent contrast
- All colors follow professional design standards

This session focused on:
1. Verification of existing implementation
2. Comprehensive testing through UI
3. Visual confirmation via screenshots
4. Marking feature as passing

DESIGN CONSISTENCY CHECK
=========================

**Compared to claude.ai:**
- White main background ✓
- Light gray surface elements ✓
- Near-black text for readability ✓

**Accessibility:**
- Text-to-background contrast excellent (WCAG AAA level)
- Color differentiation clear
- No reliance on color alone for information
