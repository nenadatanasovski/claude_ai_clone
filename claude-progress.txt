TECHNICAL DETAILS
=================

**Backend Implementation (server/server.js):**

The PUT /api/auth/profile endpoint was already implemented in Session 94:
- Accepts name, email, and avatar_url in request body
- Updates user record in database
- Returns updated user profile
- Includes proper error handling

**Frontend Implementation (src/App.jsx):**

1. saveProfile() Function (lines 905-924):
   - Makes PUT request to /api/auth/profile with updated data
   - Sends editedUserName, editedUserEmail, editedUserAvatar
   - Updates user state with response data
   - Closes profile modal
   - Reloads user data to ensure UI is updated
   - Includes error handling

2. Edit Profile Modal (lines 6271-6374):
   - Modal overlay with centered dialog
   - Three input fields:
     * Name input with placeholder "Enter your name"
     * Email input with type="email" and placeholder
     * Avatar URL input with helper text
   - Avatar Preview section:
     * Conditionally rendered when avatar URL is provided
     * Shows 64x64 circular preview image
     * Includes error handling for invalid URLs
     * Helper text for troubleshooting
   - Action buttons:
     * Cancel button - closes modal without saving
     * Save Changes button - calls saveProfile()
   - Styling matches existing modal patterns
   - Full dark mode support
   - Responsive design

3. Integration:
   - Modal triggered by "Edit Profile" option in profile dropdown menu
   - State management using existing editedUser* states
   - Leverages existing loadUser() to refresh profile after save

**Files Modified:**
- src/App.jsx: Added saveProfile() function and Edit Profile modal (108 lines)
- feature_list.json: Feature #102 marked as passing

IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS
=========================

1. **User Experience:**
   - Seamless modal flow: open menu → click Edit Profile → modal appears
   - Real-time avatar preview helps users verify their image URL
   - Clear helper text guides users on avatar URL usage
   - Changes apply immediately after saving
   - Modal closes automatically on successful save

2. **Frontend Design:**
   - Modal follows existing design system (matches Settings modal)
   - Clean, minimal form layout
   - Orange accent color for Save Changes button (brand color)
   - Proper input focus states with ring-2 ring-claude-orange
   - Accessibility considerations (labels, placeholders, helper text)

3. **Data Flow:**
   - User opens modal → fields populate from current user data
   - User edits fields → state updates via onChange handlers
   - User clicks Save → API call → database update → UI refresh
   - Profile section in sidebar updates immediately

4. **Verification Process:**
   - Used browser automation with puppeteer MCP
   - Verified modal opening from profile menu
   - Tested name update functionality
   - Tested avatar URL addition with preview
   - Verified save functionality and UI updates
   - Took screenshots at each step for documentation
