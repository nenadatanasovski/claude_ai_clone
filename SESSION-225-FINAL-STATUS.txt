2. e962d07 - Add Session 225 progress notes

**Code Added:**

State Variables:
- showMoveToFolderModal
- moveToFolderConversationId

Functions:
- openMoveToFolderModal(conversationId)
- closeMoveToFolderModal()
- moveConversationToFolder(folderId)

UI Components:
- Context menu button: "🗂️ Move to Folder"
- Move to Folder modal with folder list
- Empty state handling

FEATURE PROGRESS:
================
Before: 173/175 (98.86%)
After:  173/175 (98.86%)

Note: No features marked as passing this session because end-to-end testing
was not completed. The implementation is complete and ready for testing in
the next session.

REMAINING WORK:
==============

Feature #156 (Comprehensive end-to-end workflow):
- Status: Implementation COMPLETE ✅
- Action needed: End-to-end testing only
- Estimated time: 30-45 minutes
- All 16 steps now have working implementations

Feature #158 (Artifact iteration and collaboration):
- Status: Partially implemented
- Missing: Version comparison view (step 11)
- Estimated time: 2-3 hours to implement comparison UI

NEXT SESSION RECOMMENDATIONS:
============================

RECOMMENDED: Test Feature #156 completely (Quick Win)
- Estimated time: 30-45 minutes
- Would bring completion to 174/175 (99.43%)
- All functionality exists, just needs testing

ALTERNATIVE: Implement Feature #158 version comparison
- Estimated time: 2-3 hours
- More complex implementation
- Also brings to 174/175 (99.43%)

OPTIMAL PATH: Complete both in one session
- Estimated time: 3-4 hours
- Would achieve 100% completion (175/175)
- Project would be fully complete!

===============

Backend APIs Available:
✅ GET /api/folders - List folders
✅ POST /api/folders - Create folder
✅ POST /api/folders/:id/items - Add conversation to folder
✅ GET /api/artifacts/:id/versions - Get artifact versions

Frontend Features Implemented:
✅ Folder creation (sidebar context menu)
✅ Folder display in sidebar
✅ Move to Folder modal (newly added)
✅ Move to Project modal (existing)
✅ Artifact version selector (existing)
❌ Artifact version comparison (not implemented)

CODE QUALITY:
============
✅ Follows existing code patterns
✅ Consistent with modal implementations
✅ Proper state management
✅ Error handling included
✅ Commented and documented
✅ No breaking changes

SESSION EFFICIENCY:
==================
